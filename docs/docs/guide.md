# Guide

Entrance is an authentication solution for OpenSSH that uses blockchain as the
underlying infrastructure to manage users and keys. Leveraging
blockchain means that you don't have to run your own
infrastructure for a central component that handle your SSO.

Instead of using OpenLDAP and mess around with CN/SN/DN, we can manage
entire of your server fleet by executing smart contract. We don't even
need a UI or Dashboard because we can execute the contract directly
anywhere as long as we have a wallet
